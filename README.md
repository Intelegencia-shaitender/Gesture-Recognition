# Gesture-Recognition

Objective :

Generator Write code for generator function so, that it can provide data in batch while training model. Also, write code for preprocessing image files in generator function

Model Create models with two architectures

Convolution 3D

Convolution 2D + RNN a.	RNN with LSTM b.	RNN with GRU

Output Tune model to achieve good accuracy on train as well as validation data Provide all metric with changes done in model to tune it in the write up

dataset was provided by institute. Hence, i cannot share it here. But you can try this notebooks with any dataset that having criteria listed below:

Each video is a sequence of 30 frames (or images).
all images in a particular video subfolder have the same dimensions
different videos may have different dimensions. Specifically, videos have two types of dimensions - either 360x360 or 120x160
There are two csv(one for train, one for validation) files having path of videos
